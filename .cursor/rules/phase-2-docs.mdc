Phase 2 (Methodical Planning) is the second stage in the project analysis pipeline. Here's what it does:

1. **Purpose:** 
   Phase 2 creates a detailed analysis plan based on the findings from Phase 1. It strategically plans how to analyze the project by creating specialized agents and assigning files to each agent.

2. **Implementation:**
   - Takes the Phase 1 results and project structure as input
   - Generates a structured analysis plan with agent definitions and file assignments

3. **Key Components:**
   - **Agent Creation:** Defines 3-5 specialized agents tailored to the project's needs
   - **File Assignment:** Assigns each file in the project to the most appropriate agent
   - **Reasoning:** Provides the rationale behind the agent creation and file assignments

4. **Technical Flow:**
   1. `Phase2Analysis` class initializes with the specified model (defaults to "o1")
   2. The `run` method formats a prompt using Phase 1 results and the project tree
   3. It calls the `OpenAIAgent.create_analysis_plan()` method to generate the plan
   4. It uses `parse_agents_from_phase2()` to extract structured agent definitions
   5. Returns a dictionary with the complete plan and token usage metrics

5. **Output Format:**
   The output is structured XML containing:
   ```xml
   <reasoning>Explanation of approach</reasoning>
   <analysis_plan>
     <agent_1 name="agent-name">
       <description>Agent role description</description>
       <file_assignments>
         <file_path>path/to/file1</file_path>
         <file_path>path/to/file2</file_path>
       </file_assignments>
     </agent_1>
     <!-- More agents -->
   </analysis_plan>
   ```

6. **Configuration:**
   Like Phase 1, the model used is configurable through the `MODEL_CONFIG` dictionary in `agents.py`. By default, it uses OpenAI's O1 model with high reasoning.

This phase is critical because it creates the blueprint for how the deeper analysis in Phase 3 will be conducted, ensuring each file is analyzed by an agent with the right expertise.
