Phase 5 (Consolidation) is the final phase before the Final Analysis. It takes all the results from the previous phases (1-4) and consolidates them into a comprehensive, cohesive report.

Looking at the implementation:

1. The `Phase5Analysis` class initializes with a model configured in `config/agents.py` (by default, DeepSeek Reasoner).

2. When `run()` is called, it:
   - Takes all previous results as input
   - Formats a prompt using `format_phase5_prompt()`
   - Passes this to the configured AI model
   - Returns a consolidated report

3. The prompt instructs the model to:
   - Combine all agent findings
   - Organize by component/module
   - Create comprehensive documentation
   - Highlight key discoveries
   - Prepare a final report

The consolidated output becomes the foundation for the Final Analysis phase, which creates the actual Cursor rules.

This phase is crucial as it transforms all the individual analyses from different agents and phases into a single, coherent document that captures the project's architecture, dependencies, and technical patterns.
