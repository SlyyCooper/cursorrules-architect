# Phase 2: Methodical Planning (Config: GEMINI_WITH_REASONING)

<reasoning>
The project structure contains one HTML file (`index.html`) and one Python file (`main.py`). The initial findings confirm this simple structure, identifying `index.html` as the likely frontend and `main.py` as the likely backend. The findings also highlight the lack of dependency files and other common web project components (CSS, JS).

To analyze these files effectively, I need agents with specific expertise:
1.  An agent focused on frontend technologies, specifically HTML, to analyze `index.html`.
2.  An agent focused on backend technologies, specifically Python, to analyze `main.py`.
3.  An agent to look at the overall picture, how the frontend and backend might interact, and assess the application architecture based on both files.

Therefore, I will create three agents:
1.  **HTML Analyst:** To examine `index.html`.
2.  **Python Analyst:** To examine `main.py`.
3.  **Web Application Architect:** To examine both files together for integration, overall structure, and adherence to best practices suggested in the initial findings.

This setup ensures each file gets specific technical analysis, and the project as a whole is reviewed for its web application context. All files are assigned appropriately based on the required expertise.
